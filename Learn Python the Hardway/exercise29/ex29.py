# EXERCISE 29 - Kiswanto_D

# Variabel untuk mengambil keputusan
people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

# Decision with if-statement
if people < cats:
    print "Too many cats! the world is doomed!"

if people > cats:
    print "Not many cats! the world is saved!"

if people < dogs:
    print "The world is drooled on!"

if people > dogs:
    print "The world is dry!"

# Increment = AND Assignment Operator (dogs = dogs + 5)
dogs += 5

# Another if-statement
if people >= dogs:
    print "People are greater than or equal to dogs."

if people <= dogs:
    print "People are less than or equal to dogs."

if people == dogs:
    print "People are dogs."
