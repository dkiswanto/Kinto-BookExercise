# EXERCISE 30 - KISWANTO_D

# Variabel for comparison decision
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

# Conditional If-Statement 1 with elif + else
if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
else:
    print "We can't decide."

# Conditional If-Statement 2 with elif + else
if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
elif trucks < cars:
    print "Maybe we could take the trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

# Conditional If-Statement 3 with elif + else
if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take the trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay home then."


# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. elif : else-if, or second conditional in if-statement
# else, if the conditional not completed (terpenuhi) than statement in else will run.
# 2. Completed
# 3. Completed
# 4. Done
